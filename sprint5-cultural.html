    <p><h3><strong><em>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</em></strong></h3></p>
    <p>
    1. I can actually work from home and get alot done when I set myself goals and my enviroment is right.
    </p>
    <p>
    2. I find it hard and embarrassing to ask for help or to admit that I am stuck, but when I do I get results so that is something that I am working on getting over.
    </p>
    <p>
    3. I am so fucking afraid of what people think of me, and this stuck out massively to me when in sprint three the listening and looping exercise was introduced, and I went into some sort of weird, reluctant, passive avoidance state.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is kinda hard for me to tell what of these things has changed due to the course, and what has changed due to my new found sobriety (most likley both). Which ever it is, the life I am leading now and the way i'm thinking and being, is just so dramatically different to how I was just a few months ago. This whole new whacky world is three things, it is confusing, and it is scarey, but also it is incredibly exciting to me.

    <p><h3><strong><em>What suprised me the most</em></strong></h3></p>

    I am very suprised at how much the mind can change and grow, and very relieved at that. I am also suprised at how much of an absolutly vital role it plays in our learning.

     <h3><strong><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></strong></h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    As I explained in the first section, so basically confronting my inability to communicate without freaking out.

      <h3><strong><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</em></strong></h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    I would say that it is because this is alot of infomation to take in all at once and being able to cope with that, fit it all in, and take it all in and with a good attitude is very important and requires good time management, and concentration. 
    </p>

      <h3><strong><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></strong></h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    No it is not a waste of time at all. Without the core learning, we wouldn't be able to program as effectivley. In the core exercises we learn things that will set us up for a life of learing anything effectivly, rather then just struggling through with bad form, and learning a bunch of stuff that is likely to become invalid within a couple of years. With core learning we will also be culturally ready for any work place, and that is extremely valuable.
