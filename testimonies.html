                <h2>From my Mother</h2>
                I am Very Happy and Honored to Share My thoughts on just some Core Values of Ashleigh Anne Vivier...
 I Only Need to make a Few Points as Ashleigh herself Will Demonstrate and Prove her Value...
                And as in Some Cases Like this... "Less is More"...                I have had the pleasure of knowing Ashleigh since she was Born. Like Any child growing up she has had her Ups and Downs but as always this is part of growing up and learning about Life.
                Ashleigh certainly learned at a very early age what she believed to be Right as well as Wrong.
                She has Always been Strong Headed and Willed at the same time Loving Kind and Fiercely Loyal to her Family and Friends around her....
                            I Will Bullet Point her Core Values: (Less is More)
                 Family Is of Fundamental Importance to Ashleigh as I am sure will always be!
                Believes that Honesty Is The Best Policy and that Trust is Earned!
                Ashleigh I think believes that Maintaining a Healthy Work/Life Balance is Very Important!
                Truth Points:
                Dependability -  Always
                Reliability - Totally
                Loyalty - Without a Doubt
                Consistency - This is Always an on-going exercise
                Honesty - Totally
                Efficiency - Far to Efficient 
                Positive - Always Strives to achieve this 
                Motivated - Go Ashleigh
                Respect of Others & Nature - A Personal Passion and Pride to be sure
                Good Humour- Hahahaha This is True
                All of the above are just a few of  Ashleigh's Core Values. She has so much to offer and then some. She has Always given of her best Striving to Deliver what she believes in...
                She Also accepts that No One is perfect but will Always work on any imperfections to make right to continue to believe in herself and what she Sets out to do...
                This Young Lady is a Gem
                I Know this to be the Honest Truth as I am Her Friend....... And Mother

                  <h2>From my Wife</h2>
                  Ash is interested in lots of different things, likes change, likes learning and trying new things. 
  She is sensitive, changeable, can freak herself out with her own thoughts, is kind, thoughtful, defensive, controlling. She doesn’t know where she ends and others start sometimes and this means she’s vulnerable and affected by others more than she otherwise would be, in a way that drains her energy away from what’s important to her. 
  She is capable of a lot more change than most people, and thinks a lot about how she wants to change and why and how to go about it. She’s in a constant state of rebirth. 
  She’s highly intelligent and sensitive and knows she is but at the same time doubts it so she gets trapped in a cycle of lack of self-belief and then resentment when she sees her own lack of self-belief reflected off the people around which can throw her into a resentful and defensive spin. 
  She is competent and kind and capable and often does more for others than she does for herself which throws her out of kilter. 
  She has rid herself out of various addictive behaviours over the last few years through sheer creativeness and self-awareness. 
  She is hugely powerful and she senses it but doesn’t fully feel it yet and will go through various discomforts along the way to relaxing into that knowledge when it finally fully dawns on her.
