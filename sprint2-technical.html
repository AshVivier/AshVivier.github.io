    <h1>What is the difference between relative, fixed, and absolute positioning?</h1>
    
<p>
    There are four positions available with the position property. They are, top, right, bottom, and left. 
</p>

<p>
    The automatic positioning of elements is generally "static", which means "do not interfere" so whatever other properties used will dictate its positioning.
    The origin of an element is the top left hand corner, so whatever position element is used it will be reletive to that.
</p>
<p>
    So if you put in the position "right 10px" for example then the element will move 10px to the left of the original position
</p>

<div>
    Relative position, lets us move our elements around without messing with the flow of the document
    <br>
    Absolute position, positions its element around the parent content
    <br>
    Fixed position, positions its element around the viewport
    <br>
