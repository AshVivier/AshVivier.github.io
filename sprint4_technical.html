    <h1>One of the (many) times I got stuck</h1>

      <p> I was doing the gradebook kata challenge. I was pretty much stuck from the moment that I looked at it. After a minute of reading the error messages that it was throwing at me, and still not quite getting it. I went back and read the gradebook kata rundown properly (as clearly I didn't do so before) and that helped me understand the main objective. This was already a hell of alot better than where I was. So once I realized this, I knew that I had to make a gradebook out of the names and the scores given. I then wrote this down in pseudocode. I then read through all of the tests and figured from that as a whole what I needed to achieve. etc.... This was an interesting learning moment for me, or more of a reminder, that I really need to ensure that I fully read through requirements, and that I understand what is required before I try just fly into it, otherwise I am wasting time.

      <p><strong><em>Pseudocode.</em></strong> I am definatly getting more confident with pseudocode, I can see it being a benefit to me in the future so I am keen to continue working on it and getting better and more comfortable with this technique.
      </p>

      <p><strong><em>Trying something.</em></strong> This is handy to a certain point, I think it is important to try using the knowledge that you have, but at a certain point if trying is not working you need to just move on to a different technique.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Rubber Ducky method.</em></strong> Yes! this one has certainly been useful to me in the past, I realised the helpfulness of this by accident, basically just when I was going through what I had learned one day to a friend. I try talk myself through things when I remember, and it is definatly becomming more of a habit of mine when I get stuck. </p>

      <p><strong><em>Reading error messages.</em></strong> This is a fairly new technique to me as it has only just properly been introduced this week, however I find it helps, especially when I ensure that I am understanding every word that is being used and how that relates to code.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Console.logging.</em></strong> Console logging certainly helps to check if my code is working, I am not so much in the habit of using it yet, but perhaps furthur down the line.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Googling.</em></strong> Well I have always been a big fan of googling and it is by far my most used technique as I have been using google to gain knowledge for many years now. It has answers, thats all there is to it.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Asking peers for help.</em></strong>This is an interesting one, it makes alot of sense to do this, and I tryed it the other day, which worked out really well for me. I however struggle with this at times, as I do not want to come across completely dim. Also I don't want to bother people when they are studying. So if I get over my ego and I keep in mind the flipped classroom approach, then this is definatly a helpful way of solving problems, plus you get the added benifit of connecting with someone. </p>

      <p><strong><em>Asking coaches for help.</em></strong> I'm a bit more versed in this over asking peers for help, perhaps because that is what they are there for, and so I don't feel like I would be bothering them as much...</p>

      <p><strong><em>Improving your process with reflection.</em></strong>This technique helps alot. I feel that it is effective in a similar way to the rubber ducky technique. Going over something, even though it's not aloud like the rubber ducky technique it serves a similar purpose.</p>
