        • Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?
        
        In this excercise we learned what different codes do to a webpage. we learned that the HTML is the actual content. The CSS is the way that the content looks (The styling), like the colours, and size, and margins etc. Finally that the JS is the code that enables us to interact with the content (i'm not sure how yet). We created an html and a css file within the website we created last week using the command line, then linked them together using the file location of the CSS file in the HTML code.  
        
        • Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?
        Yes perfect amount of time.
        
        In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:
        
        #Learn HTML and CSS Challenge
        
        • What resources you used and why?
        
        I used freeCodeCamp. It seemed more intensive, however I am kinda wishing I had tried Udacity as it took a lot of time getting through the challenges. I also used w3schools.com which I enjoy the layout of and is easy to navigate.
        
        • Obstacles you came up against and how you over came them
        What are of you proud of?
        
        There were alot of times that I felt there was too much information to take in all at once and I just couldn't get what I was doing wrong. I just took a breather, and re•tried, often it was a simple spelling mistake etc. 
        
        • Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?
        No
        
        • How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?
        
        Possibly quite a bit, but there was a hell of alot of content so i'm not sure.
        
        #additional Questions
        • How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
        I'm marginally confident. I may have to do a little extra study on the stuff i'm a bit foggy on.
        
        
        • Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
        actually having a webpage with links etc makes me feel alot more capable then I was.
        
        
        • Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
        Most of it. I had a very bad week, I felt over whelmed alot and I still feel residule anxiety about certain parts that i'm still not confident with.
        
        
        • How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
        It's still there, and I am still trying to not let it get to me. basically it it telling me that at any point I am going to reach a stage where I am just not capable enough to go on. It affected me alot this week.
        
        
        • If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
        Well if I was at a bar, depending on the level of my intoxication, as I would most likely be incapable of structuring comprehensible sentences even at the most basic of levels after a few. It would also depend on the person I was talking to as I alter my audio content to match my audience..... However lets say at the begining of the evening and I am telling a mate of mine that has a short concentration span and is a bit gangster...... I would say; " Fuck! why would you ask a question like that! I stuck at explaining shit well in short. Ok so basically you make code, and the code that you make tells the content on the site what to do. You have code that makes the content, like the font and word spacing. Then the code that makes it look fancy like colours, and boxes. Then the code that lets you interact with it like lets you click on a thing and it reacts. These codes are called languages. When you put all these languages together (like they are talking to each other), and they make your page. Then you register to a domain, that you can then push your page up and from that you can make your website. Now tell me..... how do you make hash oil?"
        
        As a side note: I have a wide range of friends, they are not all Drug dealers, infact only a very small percentage are.... if any (;
