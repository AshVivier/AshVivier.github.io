             <p> I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, where I attended boarding school from the age of six. I was therefore raised by various people. From my mum, I was taught resilience, absolute love, and how to haggle like a pro at the flea markets. My Dad taught me about hard work, and the constellations in the night sky, amongst various things like how to check and record the humidity in a tobacco barn(when we hung out it was usually when he was working) . Our gardener taught me how to grow plants, and to appreciate where our food comes from, and how to make bows and arrows, dig holes, and make petrol can guitars. Our maid taught me how to laugh in life, about the Shona culture (I often rode my bike down to visit her daughter at the compound, where I would sometimes have lunch in their hut), and appreciation for what we have. From my Matrons and superintendents at boarding school and just from being at boarding school, I was taught about punctuality, organization, cleanliness, social skills, manners, and respect.
              Africa taught me a lot of my core values, it is a place where women shoot guns with the men, fought alongside the men, hunted with the men, rode motorbikes like the men, swore like the men and drank and smoked like the men (and sailors at that). However somehow in a marriage a womenâ€™s place was still the kitchen and to be subservient to their husbands. It was a magical place, with a very unique set of life lessons. 
              I feel like what I am trying to do now is not to only better myself to something unknown to me,  but to re find a previous version of myself and re-establish the true me that was lost along the way, and build upon that with new life lessons which I have gained from various experiences throughout difficult years (Minus the addictions and self-destructive behaviours).
