   <p> I am always looking for ways I can improve myself physically, and mentally (including emotionally). I fully believe that these are connected. If you are physically in good shape it has a big mental and emotional impact, and visa versa, if we are mentally fit then we are more likely to realize the important role that fitness and health play in our mental and emotional wellbeing.

    The thing that usually has to initiate one or the other is realization that the change is needed in the first place usually brought on by a trigger such as a health scare (personally or to someone to whom you are associated), or a impactful message that you listened to (this in itself is a lesson… that you can learn from anyone, at any moment, if you are open to actually listening and understanding where that person is coming from).
    I have had a sequence of triggers such as these that have led me to where I am today, in a mental and physical sense, and the changes that I have made in my life as a result of my realizations.</p>
<p></p>
     Some of the biggest points that have been the catalyst of the changes I have made have been, realization of self-worth; I am actually just as entitled to be on the planet as any one, and I am capable of anything if I set my mind to it (fucking cliché but it puts my point across).
    Realizing that there are always two sides to a story and that often perspectives on a certain truth can appear to be opposing or wrong however it is simply the same thing from a different angle, and In realizing this we can get a fuller more understanding experience, rather than a one sided, stubborn, stuck, and defensive stance. Making us less victim to the conundrum of confirmation bias when researching and developing etc in a professional and personal sense. This has improved my empathy, and ability to look at a problem from all angles, making me open and able to change bad habits and develop new great ones.  </p>
    <p>
    I am as a result more ethical and less lazy in my choices, for just one example I have become a vegan other than occasionally eating wild meat. I am a lot more calm and understanding.

  <p> Ok I ramble, but once I start going it is hard for me not to stop (ah huh! Personality trait!)</p>
