            I am pretty sceptical of anything like this, as we are ever changing and I don’t feel like I have a solid personality type as per say, I view it as a lot more fluid then this. Some aspects certainly, however I am very open to change and development and seeing things from both angles of any situation.

            Perhaps that is a trait of mine then, I am always looking for ways I can improve myself physically, and mentally (including emotionally). I fully believe that these are connected. If you are physically in good shape it has a big mental and emotional impact, and visa versa, if we are mentally fit then we are more likely to realize the important role that fitness and health play in our mental and emotional wellbeing.
            The thing that usually has to initiate one or the other is realization that the change is needed in the first place usually brought on by a trigger such as a health scare (personally or to someone to whom you are associated), or a impactful message that you listened to (this in itself is a lesson… that you can learn from anyone, at any moment, if you are open to actually listening and understanding where that person is coming from).
            I have had a sequence of triggers such as these that have led me to where I am today, in a mental and physical sense, and the changes that I have made in my life as a result of my realizations.
            <p>Some of the biggest points that have been the catalyst of the changes I have made have been, realization of self-worth; I am actually just as entitled to be on the planet as any one, and I am capable of anything if I set my mind to it (fucking cliché but it puts my point across). </p>
            <p>Realizing that there are always two sides to a story and that often perspectives on a certain truth can appear to be opposing or wrong however it is simply the same thing from a different angle, and In realizing this we can get a fuller more understanding experience, rather than a one sided, stubborn, stuck, and defensive stance.
             Making us less victim to the conundrum of confirmation bias when researching and developing etc in a professional and personal sense. This has improved my empathy, and ability to look at a problem from all angles, making me open and able to change bad habits and develop new great ones.  
            I am as a result more ethical and less lazy in my choices, for just one example I have become a vegan other than occasionally eating wild meat. I am a lot more calm and understanding. </p>
            </p> <p> Ok I ramble, but once I start going it is hard for me not to stop (ah huh! Personality trait!)

           	<p><h3> •Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            I was living on my own, when a friend of mine from around the village asked if she could stay at mine as she needed to move out of where she was at. I had been warned by another friend that she had previously lived with that she is a terrible flatmate and will use me and not resect my homes rules. </p>
           
            <p>I believed my mate completely on this as he is not the exaggerating type, however I chose to let her stay with me as I could not say no, and for some reason thought that maybe she had learned from previous occasions that it is not cool to treat mates in this way. 
            The outcome was that regardless of me setting very clear (very basic) rules, she did whatever she wanted to and treated my house and my possessions as her own, she never asked permission to use anything, and was awfully messy, and never opened the curtains or windows when I was out. </p>
           
            <p> I value my friends, so despite the clear warnings I let her stay. This can be a bit of a downfall for me, as after this experience I let almost this exact thing happen three more times with other friends/family that needed a place to stay, then ended up screwing with my life in various ways (it’s all character building really). 
            If I ever find myself in a similar situation again, I will most likely says yes, however I think I will be a lot more firm about my space and the respect they need to show or else my charity towards them will end there.</p>
            
            <div>
                <p>
           <h3> •	Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
           
           <p> I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, where I attended boarding school from the age of six. I was therefore raised by various people. From my mum I was taught resilience, absolute love, and how to haggle like a pro at the flea markets. My Dad taught me about hard work, and the constellations in the night sky, amongst various things like how to check and record the humidity in a tobacco barn(when we hung out it was usually when he was working) . Our gardener taught me how to grow plants, and to appreciate where our food comes from, and how to make bows and arrows, dig holes, and make petrol can guitars. Our maid taught me how to laugh in life, about the Shona culture (I often rode my bike down to visit her daughter at the compound, where I would sometimes have lunch in their hut), and appreciation for what we have. From my Matrons and superintendents at boarding school and just from being at boarding school, I was taught about punctuality, organization, cleanliness, social skills, manners, and respect.
            Africa taught me a lot of my core values, it is a place where women shoot guns with the men, fought alongside the men, hunted with the men, rode motorbikes like the men, swore like the men and drank and smoked like the men (and sailors at that). However somehow in a marriage a women’s place was still the kitchen and to be subservient to their husbands. It was a magical place, with a very unique set of life lessons. 
            I feel like what I am trying to do now is not to only better myself to something unknown to me,  but to re find a previous version of myself and re-establish the true me that was lost along the way, and build upon that with new life lessons which I have gained from various experiences throughout difficult years (Minus the addictions and self-destructive behaviours).  </p>
            
            <h3> •	Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
           
           <p> In terms of my learning and career development, my ability to problem solve, and my organizational skills will help me greatly. As problem solving is a main skill needed in this and most fields that you go into, and is essential to the learning process. Being able to organize my work, my day, and my environment will help keep everything in its place and make the experience a lot less muddled and stressful, therefore progressing a lot faster. 
            In terms of my limitations, I tend to be very socially anxious at times, and I often feel like I should try and figure things out for myself rather then go through the stress of having to approach a scary human being about something. I am therefore less likely to engage in group activities as well as I could if I got it through my head that I am not somehow fundamentally flawed, and will be somehow critically rejected if I engaged. Due to my fear of people (or being judged by people to be more precise) I find it hard to express exactly what I am trying to say even in the simplest of situations, I find myself grabbing at the nearest word to what I mean, which more often then not is the wrong one, so I then come across a bit of a stumbling, intellectually challenged mess (to the untrained eye perhaps even drunk). I will work on this lack of confidence, as I am already a far lot better then I was I believe this is a very difficult, yet very much obtainable challenge for me.</p>
            
            <h3> •	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            
            <p>On the last course that I did at Weltec, a group of us were trying to do a project to present to the rest of the class in the form of a brain storm of sorts. However one of the members in the group kept taking over and over riding everyone else’s suggestions despite the fact that he was not only incorrect in the information he was adding but others had gathered a lot more valid, and useful material that he was disregarding. The strategy used was basically to let him do it (I’m sure there was a lot of eye rolling) and we just learned of each other. We presented “his” brainstorm, and the teacher knowing what he was like could tell what had gone on, and made some stabbing remark toward him, about being controlling etc. This was not dealt with properly by any of us including the teacher. If I were to go through that again the strategy that I would most likely try instead would be to, calmly (but firmly) bring to attention the fact that we all have contributions to make and suggest that we make an equal amount of comments on the presentation. </p>
