        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1> 
<div>
    <p>
        Contrary to past beliefs about the structure of the brain, our brains are not actually set and unchangeable with repeated learning, new and stronger neuropathways are created.
</p>
<p>
If we can connect a piece of new information to pre-existing piece of knowledge, then it helps us come to an understanding faster, and creates a strong neuro pathway. So whenever we think of this new piece on information again, the pre-existing pathway that you attached it to fires at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
When the concept of neuroplasticity is explain to someone, just that knowledge itself improves our ability to form new and stronger pathways, like psychologically you are setting the environment up or allowing this to happen. Where if you still have the idea that your brain is set then you are less likely to even bother with learning in the first place and those areas of the brain lay dormant.
</p>
<p>
When we cease learning and practising the brain will eventually sever the cells that connect up those neurons.

<h1>Growth mind set</h1>

<p>The idea that we are born with or without certain traits inhibits growth. When we find a subject difficult and our brain hurts our natural reaction is to conclude that you were not wired that way and that it is not possible for you to learn that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
However we can in fact learn anything. The pain that you feel is actually good news as this means that the mind is in fact growing in order to gain that new information. 
</p>
<p>
This is very good news indeed. I myself have been stuck in the mindset that I only have the ability to learn certain subjects. I am now excited by my brain pain, as I am aware now that that means itâ€™s working.</p>
<h2>You can do anything if you set your Mind to it!!!</h2>
