<div style="font-family: 'Encode Sans Condensed', sans-serif;">
Whilst studying with DEV on the 5 week foundations course, there are quite a few techniques I have learned that will help me get the most out of my study.<br>
Journaling and reflecting on my experiences, will help me to learn the material by truly understanding it. Keeping in mind that my brain is changeable, and not running away when I feel it is too hard, I can’t do it, and it hurts. I need to remember that my brain hurting is the feeling of growth and learning. 
           </p> 

           <p>
Practice, practice, practice! Forming strong neuropathways between cells from plenty of practice and making connections between new material and pre-existing knowledge, will help our brains grow. 
I will be using the pomodoro technique to break all my timeboxes into chunks and ensure that my attention is optimized.</p>
<p>Setting myself goals and challenges each day and questioning the outcome, and adjusting my approach the following day accordingly.
I will be studying in my office, which is a separate room in the house, that is tidy, free for distraction and comfortable. The library will be my back up study space, in the case that there are inevitable distractions on a particular day, or I just want a change of scenery. </p>
<p>
I don’t otherwise have any other commitments during the day. The step kids are all old enough to look after themselves, and are very respectful and supportive of my new venture, so do not disturb me during study hours (other than the obvious queries etc). 
If I hit a problem, I will first attempt to figure it out myself (Google!!), if after a reasonable amount of time has past and I still am not getting it, I will then reach out to my peers, or a facilitator for help.
</p>

Our team
I’m not entirely sure how it will all go in Bootcamp, but I will ensure that when working in a group and with facilitators, to participate fully. 
When I say I will do something in a specific timeframe, or be somewhere at a specific time then I will do so, and if not possible then I will ensure that I communicate that clearly in order for us to re-plan.
My expectations of the facilitators is to be there to check in to make sure all is ticking along ok. I see them as there to help if stuck with Tech issues, by perhaps asking questions about what the issue is, and what we may have tried already. Also as we go through moments of doubt or frustration, to be able to help us re-ground our selves and re-focus our thoughts.

        <h2>Bonus stuff to help with self-improvement, and learning.</h2>
</p>

<p>Physical activity helps with brain function, and being in front of the computer all day is not helping in this regard. I decided it was time to make a conscious exercise plan around my study. 
    I have started running and cycling every second day in the mornings just after my first coffee. In my breaks I have/will be doing a variety of workouts, for example I do some weights, or planking, or sit ups. 
    I try and get outside for one of my longer breaks too, which helps with movement, change of scenery, and just simply sanity.</p>

<p>I have also started to deliberately practice mindfulness, and I meditate each evening before bed when I can. 
I keep my water bottle with me in the office, generally this is something that I have always attempted to get into the habit of for many years, but finally I feel like I’m remembering (it’s become habitual).</p>
<p>
I generally eat well (food is life….. or death {depending on the food} ), however I have made up a list of foods that will help to increase my brain function, each food is in a category based on the specific nutrient provided (all beneficial to the brain in different ways). So when I make my meal I ensure that it contains at least one food item from each category.
 I also practice Intermittent fasting. This is where I do not eat at all for 14-16 hours a day. Reducing my intake to a 8-10 hour window. What this is thought to do is increase the rate  of neurogenesis (creation of new brain cells), and boosts the production of BDNF.  BDNF has been shown to play a role in neuroplasticity, which allows the brain to continue to change and adapt. It makes your brain more resilient to stress and more adaptable to change.
I also try and learn about various other topics, through the means of ted talks and podcasts, just to keep the scenery fresh, but the mind still working. Plus I feel as though whatever the topic it is somehow connected to all others (it’s all relevant).
