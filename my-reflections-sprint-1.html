# My Reflections - Sprint One 

#Command line Primer
•	In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
Command line is an interface in which you can access and operate your computers system through. Where you can for example create files and remove files, check your system status and Trouble shoot.

•	Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
Yes I have just managed to stick to the time. It was a bit of a stress though as I find it super hard to just stick to the need to know stuff, and to not go off on wild tangents.

•	Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
cd  : this command allows you to Change Directory
mkdir   : This command allows you to Make a file 
ls   : This lists the details of the directory you are currently accessing
cd ..  : This command allows you to go back to previous directory
git add -A : This command adds all changed entries to the  directory
git commit -m: This command adds a message to your file

•	Did you learn anything unexpected?
Yes I was surprised how everything could be accessed and operated via the Command line.

# Version control with Git-Primer
•Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the version control sofware that is installed on your computer and GitHub is a opensource webservice, where people can collaberate on projects together.

•Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

It like if two people are making a salad recipe together. One is working on the dressing and the other is working on the base of the salad. Once they have finished creating on their workbenches they meet in the middle bench (or hub) where they test out combined the two when they are happy.

•Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes, infact i'm pretty sure I will have an even deeper understanding (or I'm hopeing I will anyway)

•Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not
Yes I did, go team me!

........

# Install and Explore Git
•	What is a GitHub work flow?
Creating branches for projects, then adding commits to the branch, then creating a pull request to be reviewed. You can then deploy your project for final testing before merging it with the master branch.

•	What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I did seem to take a lot longer than I think is expected to get through the work. When I got confused or blocked I would go back and see if I had missed something, making sure I read every word (this may explain how long it took me). 

•	Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I would probably read the descriptions a bit more thoroughly to start with, however I seem to be struggling with getting stuff done within the timebox, so I keep skimming then missing shit, then having to back track, creating even more of a time hole.

........

# Track and commit Primer

•	How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
The stage is basically where you would put the files in order to put into your repository, so to commit them is to make a copy of the file as it is in the staging area, into the repository. 

........

#Branch, Pull, Merge Primer

•	What is Master?
The master is the reviewed and final result of projects

•	Why create a Branch?
We create branches so that we can make changes to a clone of the main branch without changing it inevitably 

•	Do the concepts feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
I must say I am struggling to gasp it fully keeping within the timeboxes

# GitHub Fork and Clone Curriculum Challenge

What are some examples of when you would fork?
I might want to fork if I want to start a project using another repo as a base, or if I want to perhaps try something that could be risky and not want to stuff with the original repo.

Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.

1. Go to the reflections repo

2. In the top right hand corner click the fork button and click where you would like this to go.

3. Go into the new fork and go into settings and options. Click on the access box

4. click on the green Clone button, and then click on the copy clipboard icon.

5. Go into your Desktop in Git Bash Command

6. Type in Git Clone followed by the copied url

7. There should now be a folder called Reflections on your desktop.

•Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

I'm getting there

•Stage your file.

# Set Remotes and Synce Fork Primer

•What is the difference between cloning from a forked or non-forked repo.
When you clone from a forked repo the edits you do and commit get pushed up into the copy on your platform. When you clone from a non-forked repo your commits go directly to the original repo to be pulled. 

•Can you think of an analogy to describe forking?
Maybe when you are making a fondant icing and you want to try out a green dye but don't want to potentially be stuck with a shitty looking green cake. you take a sample of the plain icing and add the dye to that. Then if you are happy with that then you can copy that step into the plain icing.

•What is a remote?

A remote is a repository that is not directly on your computer.

........

# Git- Setting Remotes and Syncing Forks

•How are remotes set up?
By using git remote add followed by name and the URL.

•How would you explain a remote to a non-technical person using an analogy?

A remote is a website repository, by adding a remote you can keep a track of changes added to an original document online and add them to your copy if needed.
(so no, not really)

•How many times did you feel like "oh God I don't understand this"?
Almost every step of the way

........

# Set up New Repo and Create Blog

•Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I hardly felt frustrated, it was rather straight forward and I found it quite fun.

•If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

It was somewhat what I had pictured. I really never thought that I would be able to create something like this myself.

........

# Thinking like a programmer 
•Describe the process for solving problems
Make sure that you fully understand the problem, and plan your approach. Breaking up the problem into sub categories to solve then solve each sub-problem starting from the easiest through to the more difficult problems. then put all together and attempt to solve it. If you get stuck there is always google, try debugging, and talk it through (I now have my equivalent of a rubber ducky, in the form of a sand filled fox I was using to weigh my papers down... and my wife). 

•Will you follow that process? How?

Yes most likely, It is a proven proccess and it makes sense.
I have a note pad next to me at all times which I will use to break down my problems, then using the timebox and pomodoro technique I will make my way through each one. And as I explained the google, fox and Wife method will be used when I get stuck.

•What did you learn about flipped classroom? 
Flipped classroom is where you are given course materials before class to study up on. The class time is then used to get more in depth and collaborate with peers and facilitators. Then after class is used to reflect and practice.

#H1 Introduce yourself and get to know your cohort

What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

It did feel a bit odd to talk about what seems quite personal, and exposing. But I get it.

# Git messages (strech challenge)
                            Figure 1
In the first image it appears that they have checked their status and there are a few things to note. One is that the branch is ahead of origin/master by two commits. which means that to be up to date they would have to push up the commits to be up to date.
Two is that there is a file that has been modified and not commited, 
Three is that there have been two deleted files that are not staged for commit, and the command line suggests to add/remove file or to checkout file. 

                             Figure 2
In this image they have asked for the remote location which shows that the place that any updates get pushed to is the same location that they get fetched from. 
They then attempt to pull any udates that have been made to the origin but have hit a conflict message which appears to be in regards to a file that was deleted in branch but modified in the HEAD. 
Then when run git status this gives them a run down on the changes to be commited: 1 modified and 1 new.
The unmerged paths: before mentioned file
and changes not staged for commit: a deleted md file.

They then run a git log possibly to check what moderations were done to the file from HEAD, to decide what step to take next (whether to delete or add changes and commit).

I hadent come across the CONFLICT scenerio before, it was great to learn why this is and how to rectify.

# Additional Questions For Sprint 1

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Making a plan of attack in the beginning of the day using Google calenders, then using the timeboxes, putting my tasks into my pomodoro app has really helped my time managment.

Taking a breather when I am feeling ovewhelmed has helped too, if I just walk away for a couple of minutes and do something completly un-related, I usually find that when I look back on the task, it becomes alot clearer. 

I already had an office set up, however I think that having a study dedicated space has really helped. I was thinking that maybe on my core days I could find a spot in the library that I could use as my second space (somehow being in a public space whilst doing core seems appropriate, and a change of scenery wouldn't hurt).


- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I'm fairly confident now, I feel as though i'm a bit behind or missing bits but then somehow it all comes together. 


- Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

 I enjoyed most of it, it's all very new and I like new. It's very satisfying when you don't feel like you are getting a task then it all clicks. 


- Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

I'm a bit shit when it comes to typing speed so thats not always fun, but that's just something that I need to work on.

- Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes I usually do with most things. There are many points of self doubt, but I figure that the imporatant thing is that you try getting the self confident voice out to put in a good debate on your behalf, and prove that voice wrong by simply doing. Actions speak louder that shitty little voices in your head.
