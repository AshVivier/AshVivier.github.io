      <h3>A couple of questions were asked of me in Sprint one about experiences<br>
      Here are the questions and a couple of experiences</h3>>
      <p>
            <article>
<h4>	Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took? </h4>
      </p>I was living on my own, when a friend of mine from around the village asked if she could stay at mine as she needed to move out of where she was at. I had been warned by another friend that she had previously lived with that she is a terrible flatmate and will use me and not resect my homes rules. 
<p>
I believed my mate completely on this as he is not the exaggerating type, however I chose to let her stay with me as I could not say no, and for some reason thought that maybe she had learned from previous occasions that it is not cool to treat mates in this way. 
The outcome was that regardless of me setting very clear (very basic) rules, she did whatever she wanted to and treated my house and my possessions as her own, she never asked permission to use anything, and was awfully messy, and never opened the curtains or windows when I was out. 
I value my friends, so despite the clear warnings I let her stay. This can be a bit of a downfall for me, as after this experience I let almost this exact thing happen three more times with other friends/family that needed a place to stay, then ended up screwing with my life in various ways (it’s all character building really). 
If I ever find myself in a similar situation again, I will most likely says yes, however I think I will be a lot more firm about my space and the respect they need to show or else my charity towards them will end there.

<h4>•	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time,
     how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why? </h4>

     <p>
            On the last course that I did at Weltec, a group of us were trying to do a project to present to the rest of the class in the form of a brain storm of sorts. However one of the members in the group kept taking over and over riding everyone else’s suggestions despite 
            the fact that he was not only incorrect in the information he was adding but others had gathered a lot more valid, and useful material that he was disregarding. The strategy used was basically to let him do it (I’m sure there was a lot of eye rolling) and we just learned of each other. 
            We presented “his” brainstorm, and the teacher knowing what he was like could tell what had gone on, and made some stabbing remark toward him, about being controlling etc. This was not dealt with properly by any of us including the teacher. 
            If I were to go through that again the strategy that I would most likely try instead would be to, calmly (but firmly) bring to attention the fact that we all have contributions to make and suggest that we make an equal amount of comments on the presentation.
