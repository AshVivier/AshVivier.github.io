    <p>
        ….. My name is Ashleigh Vivier. I’m living in Paekakariki, where I have now been for 9 years (Love the coast!). 
        I’m going through somewhat of a major life restructure at present. I’m re-finding myself and strengthening my core values. 
        This has involved giving up a lot of unhealthy habits and addictions that were dulling down my mana, and blurring my experiences .
         My new found clarity has brought me to a point where I realize that the industry that I was in was not helping me progress any further,
         ad somewhat out grown it (I learned all I needed to from it). I’m ready for a completely new challenge, and I have always been interested
          in IT. </p>

    <p>
        Only now I feel that I am ready to pursue this interest. After discussing my interest in IT with customers of mine that are already
           in the industry, most of these discussions ended up with the suggestion that I enter into EDA, and it really did seem by far the most
            logical place to start my journey. When student loans became available, I had no more excuses so I just went for it! Now here I am.
        </p>

    <p>
        I look forward to getting to know you all along the way.

<h2>What shaped me</h2>
I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, where I attended boarding school from the age of six. I was therefore raised by various people. From my mum I was taught resilience, absolute love, and how to haggle like a pro at the flea markets. My Dad taught me about hard work, and the constellations in the night sky, amongst various things like how to check and record the humidity in a tobacco barn(when we hung out it was usually when he was working) . Our gardener taught me how to grow plants, and to appreciate where our food comes from, and how to make bows and arrows, dig holes, and make petrol can guitars. Our maid taught me how to laugh in life, about the Shona culture (I often rode my bike down to visit her daughter at the compound, where I would sometimes have lunch in their hut), and appreciation for what we have. From my Matrons and superintendents at boarding school and just from being at boarding school, I was taught about punctuality, organization, cleanliness, social skills, manners, and respect.
Africa taught me a lot of my core values, it is a place where women shoot guns with the men, fought alongside the men, hunted with the men, rode motorbikes like the men, swore like the men and drank and smoked like the men (and sailors at that). However somehow in a marriage a women’s place was still the kitchen and to be subservient to their husbands. It was a magical place, with a very unique set of life lessons. 
I feel like what I am trying to do now is not to only better myself to something unknown to me,  but to re find a previous version of myself and re-establish the true me that was lost along the way, and build upon that with new life lessons which I have gained from various experiences throughout difficult years (Minus the addictions and self-destructive behaviours).

    <h2>Some self searching</h2>
    I am always looking for ways I can improve myself physically, and mentally (including emotionally). I fully believe that these are connected. If you are physically in good shape it has a big mental and emotional impact, and visa versa, if we are mentally fit then we are more likely to realize the important role that fitness and health play in our mental and emotional wellbeing. The thing that usually has to initiate one or the other is realization that the change is needed in the first place usually brought on by a trigger such as a health scare (personally or to someone to whom you are associated), or a impactful message that you listened to (this in itself is a lesson… that you can learn from anyone, at any moment, if you are open to actually listening and understanding where that person is coming from).
I have had a sequence of triggers such as these that have led me to where I am today, in a mental and physical sense, and the changes that I have made in my life as a result of my realizations. Some of the biggest points that have been the catalyst of the changes I have made have been, realization of self-worth; I am actually just as entitled to be on the planet as any one, and I am capable of anything if I set my mind to it (fucking cliché but it puts my point across). Realizing that there are always two sides to a story and that often perspectives on a certain truth can appear to be opposing or wrong however it is simply the same thing from a different angle, and In realizing this we can get a fuller more understanding experience, rather than a one sided, stubborn, stuck, and defensive stance. Making us less victim to the conundrum of confirmation bias when researching and developing etc in a professional and personal sense. This has improved my empathy, and ability to look at a problem from all angles, making me open and able to change bad habits and develop new great ones.  
I am as a result more ethical and less lazy in my choices, for just one example I have become a vegan other than occasionally eating wild meat. I am a lot more calm and understanding. 
Ok I ramble, but once I start going it is hard for me not to stop (ah huh! Personality trait!)
